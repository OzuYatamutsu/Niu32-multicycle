## What is this?

This is a hardware implementation of the [Niu32 instruction set](https://github.com/OzuYatamutsu/Niu32-multicycle). It specifies a **bus-based architecture** - i.e. a simple architecture with *multiple cycles per instruction* - and is written in Verilog, targeting the Altera Cyclone II FPGA board.

The project files included assume the use of Altera's [Quartus II](https://dl.altera.com/?edition=web) IDE.
